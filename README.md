# Quick Shutdown widget for KDE 6

Plasma 6 widget for quick accessing the leave options (shutdown, reboot, suspend, logout) or to quickly switch between different users.

This is a customized version of the widget [user switcher](https://github.com/KDE/kdeplasma-addons/tree/master/applets/userswitcher) created by Kai Uwe Broulik and inspired by [Shutdown or Switch](https://github.com/Davide-sd/shutdown_or_switch) created by Davide Sandona.
